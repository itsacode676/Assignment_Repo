## React Assignment

1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?
   Implementing shared functionality across a component tree in a React application can be efficiently managed using a state management library like Redux. Redux provides a centralized store for managing the application state, which allows different parts of the application to access and modify shared data without the need for passing props down through multiple layers of components. This approach is particularly useful for complex applications with deeply nested component trees.

2. Why is the `useState` hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?
   The `useState` hook is great for handling state in complex components because it lets you keep track of different pieces of state in a straightforward way. You can use it to update state and automatically re-render the component, making it simpler to manage and organize state within a component without the extra complexity of class components.

3. Design a user interface resembling the provided page. Fetch the data from the server and dynamically map the information cards to the fetched data. Ensure that the search functionality is also implemented.
